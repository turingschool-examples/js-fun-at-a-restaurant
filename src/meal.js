// This one we reviewed in class, which helped significantly. I had 
// some trouble reading the test side and was not able to 
// independently come up with that 2 parameters are needed in the 
// function. This is where the question came up of matching the number
// of parameters to the number of arguments, which turns out makes one
// of the paramters 'undefined' if you put in 2 parameters, but just 
//  1 argument. I learned about the bang operator (!), which 
// inverses the boolean. The bang is saying that if you put in a
// unique ingredient, and it does NOT already include it, then 
// it will be pushed into the array. This allows unique and many 
// ingredients to be added to the array. The push method adds 
// to the end of the array. So it reads, that it will add the 
// singleIngredient to the end of the ingredientArray.

// 10% off a price is multiplying the initial price by

// know that you can return the title, ingredients, and type by 
// dot notation!
