// Read the instructions for each of the warm up exercises carefully. This may
// seem repetitious or pedantic at first, however it's very important that you
// become comfortable with these fundamental concepts. Do not move on to
// iteration 1 until you are confident that you've completed all of iteration 0.

//------------------------- Variables -------------------------//


// Initialize three new variables, "food", "type" and "inStock", and assign values to them with
// a food's name, type and number of items in stock.

// var food = "Ice Cream";
// var type = "Dessert";
// var inStock = 10

var food = "Mango";
var type = "Fruit";
var inStock = "2";



// Reassign (not initialize) your "inStock" variable from above. We got a new shipment! Use a built in math operator to make
// the inStock count double what it currently is.



inStock = inStock* 2;
console.log(inStock);


// Reassign (not initialize) your "inStock" variable from above. You got hungry and needed a snack!
// Use a built in math operator to decrement the inStock count by 1.

inStock = inStock - 1;
console.log(inStock);





// Initialize a new variable "isFavorite", and assign it to a boolean value indicating
// if the food you chose is your favorite food or not

isFavorite = false;




// Create a new variable named "shouldOrderMore", and use a comparison operator to
// assign a boolean value to this variable. If "inStock" is less than 20, the
// variable should be true, otherwise it should be false. You MUST use a
// comparison operator.

var shouldOrderMore = true;
if (inStock < 20) {
  shouldOrderMore = true;
} else {
  shouldOrderMore = false;
}

console.log(shouldOrderMore);





//------------------------- Conditionals -------------------------//



// Express the following in code: If the variable "stockCount" is greater or equal to 1, log
// the statement 'I'm going to eat some [food]!', otherwise, log the statement
// 'We need to get some more [food].'


var stockCount = 0;
if (stockCount >= 1) {
  console.log("I'm going to eat some " + food + ".");
} else {
  console.log("We need to get some more " + food + ".");
}




// Express the following in code: If the variable "isFavorite" is true,
// log the statement 'My favorite food is [food]!'. Otherwise, log the
// statement 'I recently ate [food]'. In either case, the value stored in
// the "food" variable should be included in the logged statement.

if (isFavorite === true) {
  console.log("My favorite food is " + food + ".");
} else {
  console.log("I recently ate " + food + ".");
}

console.log(isFavorite);





//------------------------- Arrays -------------------------//


// Create a new variable "vegetables" and assign it to an Array of 5 different
// vegetables, represented by their names as Strings.

var vegetables = ['zucchini', 'spinach', 'celery', 'beets', 'plantains'];


// Write the code to access the 3rd element of the Array, using bracket
// notation.

console.log(vegetables[2]);


// Create a new variable "fruits" and assign it to an Array of 7
// different fruits.

var fruits = ["mangos", "pi√±a", "moosambi", "limon", "limons real", "aguacate", "sandia"];


// Write the code to access the 5th element of the array, using bracket notation.

console.log(fruits[6]);


//------------------------- Objects -------------------------//

// Create a new variable called "groceryStore" and assign to it an object literal with two
// keys: name, and isOpen. The value for name should the string 'King Soopers' (or your favorite grocery store), and
// the value for isOpen should be true. Which other key value pairs would make sense to add to this object?

var groceryStore = {
  name: "Mercado California",
  isOpen: false,
  sellsMango: true,
  address: "fco villa 1313 Fluvial Vallarta",
  isExpensive: false,
  mangoCount: 1803
};
// console.log(groceryStore);



// Write the code to add the key of location, with the value of 'Denver, Colorado'. Use dot
// notation to do this. DO NOT modify your code from above.

groceryStore.location = "Puerto Vallarta, Jalisco";
console.log(groceryStore);
