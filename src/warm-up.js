// Read the instructions for each of the warm up exercises carefully. This may
// seem repetitious or pedantic at first, however it's very important that you
// become comfortable with these fundamental concepts. Do not move on to
// iteration 1 until you are confident that you've completed all of iteration 0.

//------------------------- Variables -------------------------//


// Initialize three new variables, "food", "type" and "inStock", and assign values to them with
// a food's name, type and number of items in stock.

var food = "Ice Cream";
var type = "Dessert";
var inStock = 10



// Reassign (not initialize) your "inStock" variable from above. We got a new shipment! Use a built in math operator to make 
// the inStock count double what it currently is.
inStock = inStock * 2;
console.log(inStock);

// Reassign (not initialize) your "inStock" variable from above. You got hungry and needed a snack! 
// Use a built in math operator to decrement the inStock count by 1.
inStock = inStock - 1;
console.log(inStock)

// Initialize a new variable "isFavorite", and assign it to a boolean value indicating
// if the food you chose is your favorite food or not
var isFavorite = true;


// Create a new variable named "shouldOrderMore", and use a comparison operator to
// assign a boolean value to this variable. If "inStock" is less than 20, the
// variable should be true, otherwise it should be false. You MUST use a
// comparison operator.
var shouldOrderMore = false
if(inStock < 20){
    shouldOrderMore = true;
} else {
    shouldOrderMore = false;
}
console.log(shouldOrderMore)


//------------------------- Conditionals -------------------------//



// Express the following in code: If the variable "stockCount" is greater or equal to 1, log
// the statement 'I'm going to eat some [food]!', otherwise, log the statement 
// 'We need to get some more [food].'
if(inStock >= 1){
    console.log(`I'm going to eat some ${food}`)
} else {
    console.log(`We need to get some more ${food}`)
}


// Express the following in code: If the variable "isFavorite" is true,
// log the statement 'My favorite food is [food]!'. Otherwise, log the
// statement 'I recently ate [food]'. In either case, the value stored in
// the "food" variable should be included in the logged statement.
if(isFavorite === true){
    console.log(`My favorite food is ${food}`)
} else {
    console.log(`I recently ate ${food}`)
}


//------------------------- Arrays -------------------------//


// Create a new variable "vegetables" and assign it to an Array of 5 different
// vegetables, represented by their names as Strings.
var vegetables = ['carrot', 'celery', 'lettuce', 'zuccini', 'eggplant']

// Write the code to access the 3rd element of the Array, using bracket
// notation.
console.log(vegetables[2])

// Create a new variable "fruits" and assign it to an Array of 7
// different fruits.
var fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'pear', 'tomato', 'grapes', 'strawberry', 'blueberry']

// Write the code to access the 5th element of the array, using bracket notation.
console.log(fruits[4])

//------------------------- Objects -------------------------//

// Create a new variable called "groceryStore" and assign to it an object literal with two
// keys: name, and isOpen. The value for name should the string 'King Soopers' (or your favorite grocery store), and
// the value for isOpen should be true. Which other key value pairs would make sense to add to this object?
var groceryStore = {
    name: 'King Soopers',
    isOpen: true,
}


// Write the code to add the key of location, with the value of 'Denver, Colorado'. Use dot
// notation to do this. DO NOT modify your code from above.

groceryStore.location = 'Denver, Colorado';
console.log(groceryStore)
